Building the API that WashCo didn't :(

## Background
At the University of Warwick, the washing and drying services are outsourced to an external provider called WashCo. They provide a website to check the status of a cycle (availability, time remaining, etc) however the website is quite dated, unintuitive, and sometimes doesn't even load. The aim of this project is to design and implement an API wrapper which ultimately cleanses some data which we currently have access to. This can then be used to perhaps design a mobile application, or new web app which displays the data in a cleaner, more user friendly and less obfuscated format. If you are interested in seeing the current website, you can find it [here](https://www.washpoint.uk/location/university-of-warwick/).
